# Caesar Cipher Tool

This is a simple C++ implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encrypt a message** using Caesar Cipher.
- **Decrypt a message** using Caesar Cipher.
- Input validation for shift values and encryption/decryption options.
- Allows repeated encryption and decryption within the same session.
